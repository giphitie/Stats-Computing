# Problem 1. Box-Muller transformation

The Box-Muller transformation method simulates random numbers from $N(0,1)$ as follows.

- Step 1: Generate $U_1$ and $U_2$ i.i.d. from $U(0,1)$.
- Step 2: Let $X_1 = \sqrt{-2\log U_1}cos(2\pi U_2)$ and  $X_2 = \sqrt{-2\log U_1}sin(2\pi U_2)$. 

Establish the theoretical validity of the method by proving the following results.
